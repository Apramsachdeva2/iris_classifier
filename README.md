# iris_classifier
It is a simple Hello World program in Machine learning that classifies the three types of iris flowers
In this program I have used predifined dataset in sklearn library to train the model to classify among the different types of iris flowers.
I have used four types of classifiers and fitted them with the dataset and then measured the accuracy of each classifier.
Four classifiers used in program are listed below:
1.DecisionTree Classifier
2.KNeighbor Classifier
3.RandomForest Classifier
4.GaussianNB Classifier (Naive Bayes)
